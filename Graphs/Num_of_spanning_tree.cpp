STEP 1: Create Adjacency Matrix for the given graph.
STEP 2: Replace all the diagonal elements with the degree of nodes. For eg. element at (1,1) position of 
adjacency matrix will be replaced by the degree of node 1, element at (2,2) position of adjacency matrix will
be replaced by the degree of node 2, and so on.
STEP 3: Replace all non-diagonal 1â€™s with -1.
STEP 4: Calculate co-factor for any element.
STEP 5: The cofactor that you get is the total number of spanning tree for that graph.


if a graph is a complete Grapgspaning trees are N^(N-2) where N are num of vertices/Nodes
